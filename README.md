I have developed a Python application that generates secure, random passwords tailored to user preferences, including options for password length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool features an intuitive GUI, allowing users to easily customize their password requirements and generate strong, complex passwords with a single click. Additionally, it incorporates basic password strength validation to ensure that the generated passwords meet security standards.

Technologies Used: Python, Tkinter, random module
